- nix-darwin integrated with home-manager?
- nix + m1 mac: https://github.com/vic/mk-darwin-system/
- nixos configurations
    - fix for vscode/wsl https://discourse.nixos.org/t/vscode-remote-wsl-extension-works-on-nixos-without-patching-thanks-to-nix-ld/14615
- "apple shortcuts" (next+prev space, tab in new window etc) in skhd

trouble shooting:
nix-darwin + daemon can make it such that user cannot perform nix operations (even when permitted)

try: 
    error: the store is not owned by this user, but /nix/var/nix/db is writable
    If you are using the daemon:

    sudo chown -R root:wheel /nix/var/nix/db
    Otherwise:

    sudo chown -R thomas.christensen@schibsted.com:staff /nix/store # <- adjust
or:

sudo chgrp admin /nix/var/nix/daemon-socket # <- adjust
