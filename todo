trouble shooting:
nix-darwin + daemon can make it such that user cannot perform nix operations (even when permitted)

try: 
    error: the store is not owned by this user, but /nix/var/nix/db is writable
    If you are using the daemon:

    sudo chown -R root:wheel /nix/var/nix/db
    Otherwise:

    sudo chown -R thomas.christensen@schibsted.com:staff /nix/store # <- adjust
or:

sudo chgrp admin /nix/var/nix/daemon-socket # <- adjust
